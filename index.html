            <h2>Welcome to Animals In Need</h2>
            <p>Animals in Need began with the satos (stray dogs) of Puerto Rico. Our first rescued dog Macho, 
                named after the beach he was rescued from, started it all.  He was found on the beach in 
                Puerto Rico, his face covered in dry blood, he'd lost an eye, part of an ear, tail broken in 
                two places, he was near death. He was taken to a local vet to recieve treatment for his injuries
                and <a href="link">mange,</a> which is very common in Puerto Rico.  It took several months to 
                nurse him back to health, after he was flown to Washington where we gave him the chance for 
                the life he deserved.
            </p>
            <p>Seeing the change and receiving the love and affection of a sato, made us realize that there
                are hundreds of dogs like Macho in Puerto Rico.  Dogs that are smart, loving, and just looking
                for a home to share their love. We continue to help other satos like Macho that are amazing 
                survivors, and the lives they live out after rescue is always awe-inspring.
